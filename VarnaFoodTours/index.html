                        <P>In this walking and tasting tour you will be able to get to know Varna as a culinary and historical destination. In my quest to represent the city and its culture in a slightly different way, I have chosen a considerable amount
                            of food and drinks to be experienced, hence our tasting experience is a perfect full day activity. Believe or not, the 6 hours go very fast when you spend a whole day walking and trying different kind of food and drinks
                        </P>

                    <p>What you have to know is that the places are carefully hand- selected and in each of them, I have sat down with the owners to devise the best possible menu to taste Bulgarian national cuisine. Besides the food, the drinks are specially
                        selected to pair up the tasting and have an overall unique experience. The whole experience happens by foot, so donâ€™t worry- you will get to know the center as well

                            <h2>Because It`s all about culture...</h2>
                            <p>Varna has an unique character that dates back to hundreds of thousands of years when the first signs of human life are found on the Balkan Peninsula. Since the city is already internationally recognized for its archaeological
                                heritage, Varna Food Tours would like to portray the city through its emblematic buildings from the beginning of the 20th century. At this period of time the city went under a vast construction and planning. You will be
                                able to taste a bunch of different traditional dishes made with local ingredients ranging from eating pastry on the street to having a private wine tasting experience.
